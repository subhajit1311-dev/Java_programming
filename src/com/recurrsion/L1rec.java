    //*** why we are use recursion?
    //it helps us to solve bigger or more complex problems in a simple way
    //you can convert the recursive solution to the iterations and vice-versa

    //space complexity in recursion is not constant
    //it helps us in breaking down bigger problems in smaller problem

    //RECURSIVE TREE->
    //for visualising the functions calls we draw a tree structure of those
    // calls for better understanding
